This program receives an input text file of 7-segment invoice numbers, and outputs a text file with the parsed invoice numbers.
The input file needs to follow this format:

- Each invoice number is constructed of 9 digits [0..9]
- Invoice number is written using ‘_’ and ‘|’ characters.
- Invoice number input takes 4 lines.
- The first 3 lines contain 27 characters.
- The fourth line is blank.

In this program, a 7-segment digit is represented by a boolean vector in length of 9 (3*3),
where True indicates a ‘_’ or ‘|’ char is present, and False represents a space char.
The first 3 variables of the boolean vector are the first row of the 7-segment digit it represents,
the next 3 variables are the second row, and the last 3 variables are the third row.
For example, the digit 2, has a 7-segment form of:
 _
 _|
|_

which means, that the first row contains: a space, followed by ‘_’ and another space, represented by False, True, False
the second row contains: a space, ‘_’, ‘|’ represented by False, True, True
the third row contains: ‘|’, ‘_’ represented by True, True, False
therefore, for the digit 2, the boolean vector will be (False, True, False, False, True, True, True, True, False).

configuration.py contains the assumptions. In order to make changes (in the digit size or the number of chars in a line),
it needs to be done in the configuration file.


In order to run the program, this should be done as follow:
python invoice_parser.py -i <input_file_name> -o <output_file_name>
python invoice_parser.py -h for those instructions.
